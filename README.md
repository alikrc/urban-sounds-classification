This project aims to create a model for classifing urban sounds. UrbanSounds8K dataset is used to train the model. 
Sounds turned into spectograms and converted to grayscale, resized then normalized. They labeled and splitted for validation and training.

UrbanSounds8K dataset:

0 = air_conditioner
1 = car_horn
2 = children_playing
3 = dog_bark
4 = drilling
